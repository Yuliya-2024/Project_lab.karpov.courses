The marketing team decided to hold a flash mob in the feed: participants must make a post where they tell some interesting fact about themselves and publish it with the hashtag. The three posts with the most likes receive prizes.

But due to high activity, users began to receive complaints that the application was freezing.

The flash mob took place from 2024-01-12 to 2024-01-18.

Task №1: evaluate the effectiveness of this event
Task №2: make a forecast of the selected metric to help developers configure the application for load
