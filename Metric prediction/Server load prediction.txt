Task for developers: to solve the problem with application freezing
Analytics task: help developers with server load prediction


Messenger:
All the time messenger activity is total linear and haven't trend. Let's evaluate different models to make better metric predict.

Evaluated models:
1. Obviously, users activity has a linear zero trend; model accuracy is good
2. The prediction is same, but model accuracy is worst
3. The prediction is same, but model accuracy is in the middle level

Conclusion: 
- the load is stable and does not increase (active users amount have a growth trend, but average activity has decrease, as a result, the total activity does not change)
- expected server load through a month - near 13 000 messages per day



Feed:
The active users amount is growing faster than their total activity

Evaluated models:
1. Simple models:
   linear model better than loglinear (linear model has worst test accuracy and wider confidence interval)
2. Model with trend and regressor:
   totally same
3. Model with trend, regressor and anomaly:
   totally same

The best prediction model is loglinear simple model

Conclusion: 
- the server load is increasing
- total activity has growth trend, but is slowing
- expected server load through a month - near 800 000 clicks per day





Developers should optimaze only feed server params
