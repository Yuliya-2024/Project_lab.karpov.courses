Conclusions:

T-test:
    - test results show that the average values in the two groups don't differ statistically - False
    - distribution of avg. CTRs show that the test group has a bimodal distribution => T-test cannot correctly evaluate the results
    
Mann-Whitney test:
    - test results show (only by pvalue) that the avg. values in samples are different - True
    - test checks equality of distributions - it is not equal => H1 is correct
    - test cannot show does avg. values really different or not, that's why we should use an additional method
    
T-test smoothed CTR:
    - test results show that statistically the average values in two groups don't differ - False
    - distribution of avg. smoothed CTRs show that it has a difference (test group win)
    - can use this method as an addition to show that only just with a smoothed metric the test group seems more effective
        
Poisson bootstrap:
    - distribution of avg. show that the test group avgs beveled to the left side relatively the control group avgs, i.е. on the average, test users showed the worst CTR result
    - test looks like the reality at this moment, could use it like an additional method
    
Bucket Conversion Method:
    - test results show that the average values in two groups do differ statistically - True
    - the histogram show that most buckets in the control group have avg. CTR about 21% and test group - about 19-20%
    - the difference is insignificant, but the histogram show that in the control group most CTRs are highest
    - the method works correctly
    
    


Choice of method:
    - Mann-Whitney test show that the control and the test group values distribution differ from each other
    - bootstrap and bucket are the same and show that avgs distribution of CTRs have just a slight differences between the control group side
    - smoothed T-test show that if you drop tails from the groups' distributions, then the test group will show better results => test group has more anomalies, like a low count of likes and views (it can show the highest CTR, but it will be unrelevant)

    


The А/В-test results:
    - test group users are divided: someone has more likes, someone less
    - it's also possible that users in the test group don't like a new recommendation system and now they spend less time in feed service (they often likes, but have less views - CTR high)
    - because the new system implies users view posts which were liked by similar users, we can assume that CTRs decline show that similar users don't have similar interests
    - CTRs in the test group have more decrease than in the control group
